<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Builds the single self-contained exe that goes on a plant laptop, and the manifest that tells
    an older copy it is out of date.

.DESCRIPTION
    PublishSingleFile and SelfContained are deliberately NOT in RobControl.App.csproj: setting them
    there pins a RuntimeIdentifier onto every ordinary build and every test run. They belong to the
    act of shipping, so they live here.

    The short commit hash is passed as SourceRevisionId, which the SDK appends to
    AssemblyInformationalVersion. The result reports itself as 0.5.0+a1b2c3d rather than 0.5.0, and
    that suffix is the difference between a version and a build - which is what a backup manifest
    record from six months ago needs in order to be interpreted.

    A working tree with uncommitted changes is stamped -dirty. It still builds; it is just marked,
    because an exe that cannot be traced back to a commit is one nobody should be handed.

.PARAMETER Configuration
    Release unless you are debugging the publish itself.

.PARAMETER Runtime
    win-x64. There has never been a plant laptop here that was anything else.

.PARAMETER DownloadUrl
    Written into version.json as where this build can be fetched from. Optional: it defaults to the
    repository's releases page, which is where the app itself looks.

.PARAMETER Installer
    Also wrap the exe with Inno Setup, producing dist_installer\RobControl-Setup-<version>.exe.
    Needs Inno Setup 6 on the machine. The release workflow passes this; a local build does not
    have to.

.PARAMETER SkipTests
    Do not run the suite first. For iterating on the packaging itself, and for the release workflow,
    which has already run the tests as their own step so a failure says "tests" rather than
    "publish". Never for a build anybody is going to be handed.
