/// axes yet must still load. <see cref="Theme.Normalise"/> is the one place junk turns back into

/// <para>The last three are File Manager 0.48's "theme changes by itself": <see cref="Follow"/> is

/// <see cref="LightTheme"/> or <see cref="DarkTheme"/> according to Windows' own app mode, and
/// <see cref="ThemeName"/> is what is used if Windows cannot be asked. Same names in the JSON as
