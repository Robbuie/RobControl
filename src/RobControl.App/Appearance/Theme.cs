/// Shared appearance system - themes, accent and chrome density.
///
/// <para>This is the WPF port of the design system in the Redline PDF app
/// (<c>src/css/app.css</c>) and the DWG viewer (<c>src/theme.py</c>), so all three applications
/// read as one product. <b>The catalogs below are copied value for value from theme.py</b> - same
/// token names, same hex, same labels and notes - so a change made in one app can be diffed
/// straight against the others. Only the mechanism differs, and it has to: Qt substitutes
/// <c>var(--bg-1)</c> into a text stylesheet, WPF resolves <c>{DynamicResource bg-1}</c> against a
/// resource dictionary. The tokens are the contract; the delivery is per-toolkit.</para>
///
/// <para><b>The three axes are independent, and that is deliberate.</b> A theme sets the greys.
/// The accent sets one colour. The density sets the chrome metrics. Anything that mixes them - a
/// theme that hardcodes a red, a density that also shifts a colour - means the combinations
/// multiply and half of them look wrong. There are 11 x 6 x 3 = 198 combinations here and none of
/// them needs its own block.</para>
///
/// <para><b>The accent is one channel triple, not a hex.</b> Every tint of it - the fill behind a
/// checked button, the border on an active row, the progress chunk - is derived from the triple by
/// <see cref="AccentTokens"/>. Writing a literal accent-looking colour into a XAML style re-pins
/// that one spot to whatever the default happens to be and it stops tracking the picker, which
/// reads as a picker that half works. <c>ThemeTests</c> fails on a literal colour in
/// <c>Controls.xaml</c>.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Three tokens exist here that theme.py does not have</b>, and they are marked where they
/// are defined: <c>bad</c>, the row tints, and <c>grid-row-h</c>. The viewer apps show a drawing and
/// report faults in a status line; this one is a table of device states, so it needs a red that is
/// not the accent and a set of row washes derived from the status colours. They are worth
/// back-porting to theme.py rather than being kept private here - the same table would help the
/// PDF app's comment list.</para>
