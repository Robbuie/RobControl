/// <para><b>Why this is not a logging package.</b> The product is one self-contained exe copied
/// onto a plant laptop, every dependency is a dependency somebody has to justify to plant IT, and
/// the requirement here is small and completely known: timestamped lines, a file that does not grow
/// without limit, a few days of history, and an absolute guarantee that it cannot throw. That is
/// under two hundred lines, so it is under two hundred lines - the same argument that produced
/// <c>CsvFile</c> and the packed OUI table rather than two more packages.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Every line is flushed.</b> The single most valuable entry in this file is the last one
/// before a crash, and a buffered writer is precisely the thing that loses it. This costs
/// throughput that a tool writing a few lines a minute does not have to care about.</para>
///
/// <para><b>It fails silently, once.</b> If the disk is full or the folder is read-only, the log
/// disables itself and records why in <see cref="LastFailure"/> rather than throwing into whatever
/// was being described - which, since this runs inside the crash handlers, would replace a
/// reportable fault with an unreportable one.</para>
